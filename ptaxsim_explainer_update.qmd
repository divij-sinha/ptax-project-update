## What are property taxes?

Property tax is owed by property owners annually, for both residential and commercial properties. 

These liabilities are decided per `r render_name("property parcel", render_pin14)`, and each parcel is uniquely identifiable with a 14-digit `r render_name("Property Index Number", render_pin14)` or `r render_name("PIN", render_pin14)`

Every `r render_name("PIN", render_pin14)` belongs to multiple tax districts (local government bodies), that need funds for their purposes. 

The Cook County Assessor's Office, the State, and county taxing districts (schools, parks, etc.) work together to calculate fair property taxes for residents.

The property taxes are collected centrally and then distributed to each district

## Breaking the bill down - Your local school district!

One of these districts is your local school district - `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)`! A portion of your taxes is sent to the agency to ensure it can continue operations.

```{r init-map}
small_school %>%
    map_dist()
```

Now, let's look at the line item of the bill for `r render_name(render_pin14)` in `r year` for `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)` -

```{r increment-tax-bill-1}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(agency_num == small_school$AGENCY) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = list(
            cells_column_labels(columns = agency_name),
            cells_body(columns = agency_name),
            cells_row_groups()
        )
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_fill(color = css_colors[small_school$agency_name]),
        locations = cells_body()
    )
```

For the purpose of operating `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)`, in `r year`, it needs to collect `r small_school %>% pull(agency_total_ext) %>% label_dol_amt() %>% render_name(small_school$agency_name)` in order to provide services.

```{r increment-tax-bill-1-1}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(agency_name == small_school$agency_name) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = list(
            cells_column_labels(columns = agency_total_ext),
            cells_body(columns = agency_total_ext)
        )
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_fill(color = css_colors[small_school$agency_name]),
        locations = cells_body()
    )
```

But where can `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)` raise the money from? From all the properties within the district boundaries!  
The total taxable value of all properties falling in `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)` make up its **tax base**. 
For `r year`, this was `r small_school %>% pull(agency_total_eav) %>% label_dol_amt() %>% render_name(small_school$agency_name)`

```{r increment-tax-bill-1-2}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(agency_name == small_school$agency_name) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = list(
            cells_column_labels(columns = agency_total_eav),
            cells_body(columns = agency_total_eav)
        )
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_fill(color = css_colors[small_school$agency_name]),
        locations = cells_body()
    )
```

The cost of services of `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)` is therefore divided amongst all the property owners, and `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)` sets its agency tax rate equal to: 

$$
\mathrm{{Levy \over Base} = Tax \hspace{0.1cm} rate}
$$

Using real numbers, the tax rate equals: 
$$
\mathrm{`r label_dol_amt(small_school$agency_total_ext)` \over `r label_dol_amt(small_school$agency_total_eav)`} = `r label_p_ltx(small_school$agency_tax_rate)`
$$

```{r increment-tax-bill-1-3}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(agency_num == small_school$AGENCY) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = list(
            cells_column_labels(columns = agency_tax_rate),
            cells_body(columns = agency_tax_rate)
        )
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_fill(color = css_colors[small_school$agency_name]),
        locations = cells_body()
    )
```

#### How much do you owe `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)`?

As the owner of `r render_name(render_pin14)`, in the year `r year` your property is worth `r render_name(label_dol_amt(pin_details$av*10), render_pin14)`, of that, your taxable amount (or addition to the tax base) is `r render_name(label_dol_amt(pin_details$eav - pin_exe_total), render_pin14)`[^exemptionnote].

The previously calculated `r render_name("rate", small_school$agency_name)` is then applied to your `r render_name("addition to the tax base", render_pin14)`:

$$
(`r label_dol_amt(pin_details$eav - pin_exe_total)` * `r label_p_ltx(small_school$agency_tax_rate)`) = `r label_dol_amt((pin_details$eav - pin_exe_total)*small_school$agency_tax_rate)`
$$

This is the total tax amount you owe to `r render_name(small_school$agency_name)`


[^exemptionnote]:  
    `r if(pin_exe_total == 0) {"<!--"}` 
    This is taking into account the exemptions that your property qualifies for.
    This property qualifies for the following - 

    ```{r exe-det}
    pin_exe_details %>%
        filter(value > 0) %>%
        select(name) %>%
        gt() %>%
        cols_label(
            name = "Exemption Type",
        #    value = "Exemption Amount"
        ) %>%
        #fmt_currency(value) %>%
        fmt(columns = name, fns = exe_clean)
    ```

    The total exemption value is `r render_name(label_dol_amt(pin_exe_total), render_pin14)`
    `r if(pin_exe_total == 0) {"-->"}`
    `r if(pin_exe_total != 0) {"<!--"}`  
    This house qualifies for no exemptions
    `r if(pin_exe_total != 0) {"-->"}`  

```{r increment-tax-bill-1-5}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(agency_name == small_school$agency_name) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = list(
            cells_column_labels(columns = tax_amt_post_exe),
            cells_body(columns = tax_amt_post_exe)
        )
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_fill(color = css_colors[small_school$agency_name]),
        locations = cells_body()
    )
```

That was the whole first line!

### Other School Districts

Now, the PIN, `r render_name(render_pin14)` also has other school districts that need their own funds, these are as follows -

::: {.column-margin}

`r if(!"Board Of Education" %in% other_schools$AGENCY_DESC) {"<!--"}`
> The `r render_name("Board Of Education")` is partially funded by property taxes and runs the Chicago Public Schools system, a K-12 system in the City of Chicago.
> 
> [Chicago Public Schools, Revenue, 2023](https://www.cps.edu/about/finance/budget/budget-2023/revenue/)
`r if(!"Board Of Education" %in% other_schools$AGENCY_DESC) {"-->"}`
`r if(!"Chicago Community College District 508" %in% other_schools$AGENCY_DESC) {"<!--"}`
> `r render_name("Chicago Community College District 508")` is partially funded by property taxes and runs the City Colleges of Chicago, a system of seven accredited colleges across the City of Chicago
> 
> [City Colleges of Chicago, Final Budget, FY 22](https://www.ccc.edu/departments/Documents/Finance%20Documents/FY2022%20Final%20Annual%20Operating%20Budget%20Book.pdf)
`r if(!"Chicago Community College District 508" %in% other_schools$AGENCY_DESC) {"-->"}`

:::

```{r school-map-indi}
plt_lst <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(other_schools)) {
    plt_lst[[i]] <- map_dist(other_schools[i, ])
}

Reduce("+", plt_lst) +
    plot_layout(guides = "collect") &
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

These school districts also add their own line items to the bill - 

```{r increment-tax-bill-5}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(
        agency_major_type == "School"
    ) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = cells_body(rows = agency_name %in% other_schools$AGENCY_DESC)
    ) %>%
    data_color(
        method = "factor",
        rows = agency_major_type == "School",
        columns = agency_name,
        target_columns = everything(),
        fn = css_get_colors,
        autocolor_text = FALSE
    )
```


But school districts aren't the only local government you must pay taxes to...

### The Township and the Municipality

Illinois is a state that also has a sub-county level of local government known as the township. This could be distinct from the municipality of your parcel!

::: {.column-margin}

`r if(!"CITY OF CHICAGO" %in% tax_bill_data$agency_name) {"<!--"}`
> The `r render_twn_muni()` uses the property tax levy for - 
> 
>  - Servicing long term debt (partially)
>  - The Annuity and Benefit Funds for the police, firefighters, municipal employees, and laborers and retirement board employees (partially)
> 
> [City of Chicago, Budget Overview, 2023](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/obm/supp_info/2023Budget/2023-OVERVIEW.pdf)

`r if("CITY OF CHICAGO" %in% tax_bill_data$agency_name) {"<!--"}`
>  `r render_twn_muni()` could use these funds for generally running city services including water, police, street maintenance etc.
`r if("CITY OF CHICAGO" %in% tax_bill_data$agency_name) {"-->"}`

:::

`r render_name(render_pin14)` belongs to the following - 
```{r town-muni-data}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(agency_minor_type %in% c("MUNI", "TOWNSHIP")) %>%
    select(agency_minor_type, agency_name) %>%
    mutate(agency_minor_type = ifelse(agency_minor_type == "MUNI", "MUNICIPALITY", agency_minor_type)) %>%
    gt() %>%
    cols_label(
        agency_minor_type = "Local Government Level",
        agency_name = "Taxing Agency Name"
    ) %>%
    fmt(c(agency_name, agency_minor_type), fns = str_to_title) %>%
    data_color(
        method = "factor",
        columns = agency_name,
        target_columns = everything(),
        fn = css_get_colors,
        apply_to = "fill",
        autocolor_text = FALSE
    )
```

These are often named quite similarly, and are even coterminous in a few cases.

Let's see boundaries of `r render_twn_muni()`, and where the parcel falls in them!

```{r town-muni-map}
plt_lst <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(shp_bnd_twn_muni)) {
    plt_lst[[i]] <- map_dist(shp_bnd_twn_muni[i, ])
}

Reduce("+", plt_lst) +
    plot_layout(guides = "collect") &
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

These add other line items to your tax bill...

```{r increment-tax-bill-3}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(
        agency_major_type == "School" |
            agency_minor_type == "MUNI" |
            agency_minor_type == "TOWNSHIP"
    ) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School", "Municipality/Township")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = cells_body(rows = agency_major_type != "School")
    ) %>%
    data_color(
        method = "factor",
        rows = agency_major_type != "School",
        columns = agency_name,
        target_columns = everything(),
        fn = css_get_colors,
        autocolor_text = FALSE
    )

```

Within `r render_twn_muni()`, there are also other districts that your property belongs to. These are run by the respective agency but collect tax separately. These are as follows -

```{r increment-tax-bill-4, echo=F}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(
        agency_major_type %in% c("School", "Municipality/Township")
    ) %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School", "Municipality/Township")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = cells_body(
            rows =
                (agency_major_type != "School") &
                    !(agency_name %in% (tax_bill_data %>%
                        filter(agency_minor_type %in% c("MUNI", "TOWNSHIP")) %>%
                        pull(agency_name))
                    )
        )
    ) %>%
    data_color(
        method = "factor",
        rows = (agency_major_type != "School") &
            !(agency_name %in% (tax_bill_data %>%
                filter(agency_minor_type %in% c("MUNI", "TOWNSHIP")) %>%
                pull(agency_name))
            ),
        columns = agency_name,
        target_columns = everything(),
        fn = css_get_colors,
        autocolor_text = FALSE
    )
```

::: {.column-margin}

`r if(!"City Of Chicago" %in% tax_bill_data$agency_name) {"<!--"}`

:::

Similarly, there are also other special purpose tax districts as follows - 

### Special districts 

Similarly, there are a few other miscellaneous districts

```{r others-map-indi}
plt_lst <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(shp_bnd_all_others)) {
    plt_lst[[i]] <- map_dist(shp_bnd_all_others[i, ])
}

Reduce("+", plt_lst) +
    plot_layout(guides = "collect") &
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

All of these also add their own line items to the tax bill - 

```{r increment-tax-bill-6}
tax_bill_data %>%
    filter(agency_major_type != "Cook County") %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School", "Municipality/Township", "Miscellaneous")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = cells_body(rows = !(agency_major_type %in% c("Municipality/Township", "School")))
    ) %>%
    data_color(
        method = "factor",

### Cook County tax district

Similarly, `r render_name("Cook County")` is one of the local government bodies that `r render_name(render_pin14)` falls in, with it's own set of tax districts. 

```{r init-map-old}
pin_bbox <- st_bbox(shp_bnd_pin)
pin_xlim <- c(pin_bbox$xmin - 0.02, pin_bbox$xmax + 0.02)
pin_ylim <- c(pin_bbox$ymin - 0.015, pin_bbox$ymax + 0.015)

road_map <- ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = cook_roads, color = alpha("#888888", map_road_alpha), lwd = map_road_lwd)

main_map <- road_map +
    geom_sf(
        data = shp_bnd_cook,
        aes(fill = "Cook County", color = "Cook County"),
        alpha = map_fg_fill_alpha, lwd = map_fg_lwd
    ) +
    geom_rect(
        aes(xmin = pin_xlim[1], xmax = pin_xlim[2], ymin = pin_ylim[1], ymax = pin_ylim[2]),
        color = map_colors[1], fill = NA, lwd = 1.2
    ) +
    geom_sf(
        data = shp_buf_pin,
        alpha = 1,
        lwd = map_fg_lwd,
        fill = "white", color = "white"
    ) +
    geom_sf(
        data = shp_bnd_pin,
        alpha = map_fg_fill_alpha,
        lwd = map_fg_lwd,
        aes(fill = render_pin14, color = render_pin14)
    ) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = map_colors, name = "Extent", drop = FALSE, breaks = map_names) +
    scale_color_manual(values = alpha(map_colors, map_color_alpha), name = "Extent", drop = FALSE, breaks = map_names) +
    theme_void() +
    theme(
        plot.margin = margin(0, 1, 0, 1, unit = "cm"),
        legend.position = c(0.1, 0.6)
    )

inset_map <- main_map +
    geom_sf(data = cook_roads, color = alpha("#888888", map_road_alpha), lwd = map_road_lwd + 0.2) +
    coord_sf(xlim = pin_xlim, ylim = pin_ylim, expand = FALSE) +
    theme_void() +
    guides(colour = "none", fill = "none", alpha = "none")

main_map +
    inset_element(inset_map, -0.1, 0, 0.37, 0.4, align_to = "full")
```

Now, `r render_name("Cook County")` and its tax districts add the following lines to the tax bill, resulting in the complete bill! -

```{r increment-tax-bill-2}
tax_bill_data %>%
    render_bill(
        c("School", "Municipality/Township", "Miscellaneous", "Cook County")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
        locations = cells_body(rows = (agency_major_type %in% c("Cook County")))
    ) %>%
    data_color(
        method = "factor",
        rows = (agency_major_type %in% c("Cook County")),
        columns = agency_name,
        target_columns = everything(),
        fn = css_get_colors,
        autocolor_text = FALSE
    )
```

`r if(!isTRUE(nchar(tif_agency_nums) > 0)) {"<!--"}`

## TIFs!

TIFs or Tax Increment Financing districts are special vehicles that redirect your funding towards other purposes

Your parcel - `r render_name(render_pin14)` - belongs to the following TIFs - 

```{r tif-data}
tax_bill_data %>%
    select(tif_agency_name, tif_share) %>%
    unique() %>%
    gt() %>%
    cols_label(
        tif_agency_name = "TIF Name",
        tif_share = "Share of TIF"
    ) %>%
    fmt(tif_agency_name, fns = str_to_title) %>%
    fmt_percent(tif_share) %>%
    data_color(
        method = "factor",
        columns = tif_agency_name,
        target_columns = everything(),
        fn = css_get_colors,
        apply_to = "fill",
        autocolor_text = FALSE
    )

```

```{r tif-map-indi, eval = isTRUE(nchar(tif_agency_nums) > 0)}
plt_lst <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(shp_bnd_tifs)) {
    plt_lst[[i]] <- map_dist(shp_bnd_tifs[i, ])
}

Reduce("+", plt_lst) +
    plot_layout(guides = "collect") &
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The way TIFs work is by funnelling a share of all your (post-exemption) taxes to the special purpose of the TIF.  

The share of the TIF differs every year. It works by freezing the tax base of the Municipality to the year that the TIF was enacted, and any increase in the Tax Base is redirected to the TIF.  

This means that for `r render_name(cook_county_max_ext$agency_name, "Cook County")`, the following amount is siphoned off to the TIF 

$$
`r cook_county_max_ext$agency_tax_amount` * `r label_p_ltx(cook_county_max_ext$tif_share)` = `r label_dol_amt(sum(cook_county_max_ext$final_tax_to_tif + cook_county_max_ext$rpm_tif_to_dist))`
$$

Similarly, each tax district contributes - 

```{r tif-bill-1, eval = isTRUE(nchar(tif_agency_nums) > 0)}
tax_bill_data %>%
    mutate(final_tif_tax = final_tax_to_tif + rpm_tif_to_dist) %>%
    mutate(final_dist_tax = tax_amt_post_exe - final_tif_tax) %>%
    select(agency_name, tax_amt_post_exe, tif_share, final_tif_tax, final_dist_tax, agency_major_type) %>%
    group_by(agency_major_type) %>%
    gt() %>%
    cols_label(
        agency_name = "Tax District",
        tax_amt_post_exe = "Final Tax Owed",
        tif_share = "TIF Share",
        final_tif_tax = "Amount directed to TIF",
        final_dist_tax = "Amount directed to Agency"
    ) %>%
    row_group_order(c("Cook County", "Municipality/Township", "School", "Miscellaneous")) %>%
    fmt(agency_name, fns = str_to_title) %>%
    fmt_currency(c(final_tif_tax, final_dist_tax, tax_amt_post_exe)) %>%
    fmt_percent(tif_share) %>%
    tab_options(row_group.as_column = T) %>%
    grand_summary_rows(
        fns = list(
            label = "Amount directed to TIF",
            id = "sum",
            fn = "sum"
        ),
        columns = final_tif_tax,
        fmt = ~ fmt_currency(., rows = "sum")
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = list(
            cell_fill(color = css_colors[shp_bnd_tifs$agency_name])
        ),
        locations = list(
            cells_body(columns = final_tif_tax),
            cells_column_labels(columns = final_tif_tax),
            cells_grand_summary(columns = final_tif_tax)
        )
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = list(
            cell_text(weight = "bold")
        ),
        locations = list(
            cells_body(columns = final_dist_tax),
            cells_column_labels(columns = final_dist_tax),
            cells_stub_grand_summary(),
            cells_grand_summary(columns = final_tif_tax)
        )
    )
```

The total property tax diverted to the `r render_name(shp_bnd_tifs$agency_name)` is `r render_name(label_d(sum(tax_bill_data$final_tax_to_tif, tax_bill_data$rpm_tif_to_dist)) ,shp_bnd_tifs$agency_name)`

The column **"Amount directed to Agency"** is the share of your total property tax contributions that actually go to said agencies!

`r if(!"030210900" %in% tif_agency_nums) {"<!--"}`
### Special TIF 

The Red-Purple Modernisation TIF is a special one!  

Of it's collections, it redirects some money back to the districts, and a chunk of money to the Chicago Public Schools! 

In our case, of the `r render_name(label_d(sum(tax_bill_data$final_tax_to_tif, tax_bill_data$rpm_tif_to_dist)) ,shp_bnd_tifs$agency_name)` directed to the TIF -  

 - `r render_name(label_d(sum(tax_bill_data$rpm_tif_to_rpm)), shp_bnd_tifs$agency_name)` - To the `r render_name(shp_bnd_tifs$agency_name)`
 - `r render_name(label_d(sum(tax_bill_data$rpm_tif_to_cps)), "Board Of Education")` - To the `r render_name("Chicago Public Schools", "Board Of Education")`
 - `r label_d(sum(tax_bill_data$rpm_tif_to_dist))` - Back to the districts 

Therefore, the final tax collection for each tax district (adding back the share for the `r render_name("Chicago Public Schools", "Board Of Education")`, and the amount back to the other districts) looks as follows - 

```{r tif-final, eval = isTRUE(nchar(tif_agency_nums) > 0)}
tax_bill_data %>%
    mutate(final_tif_tax = final_tax_to_tif + rpm_tif_to_dist) %>%
    mutate(final_dist_tax = tax_amt_post_exe - final_tif_tax) %>%
    mutate(rpm_tif_to_dist = ifelse(agency_name == "Board Of Education", sum(tax_bill_data$rpm_tif_to_cps), rpm_tif_to_dist)) %>%
    mutate(total_tax_agency = final_dist_tax + rpm_tif_to_dist) %>%
    select(agency_name, final_dist_tax, agency_major_type, rpm_tif_to_dist, total_tax_agency) %>%
    group_by(agency_major_type) %>%
    gt() %>%
    cols_label(
        agency_name = "Tax District",
        final_dist_tax = "Amount directed to Agency",
        rpm_tif_to_dist = "TIF back to Agency",
        # rpm_tif_back = "TIF to CPS",
        total_tax_agency = "Total amount to Agency"
    ) %>%
    row_group_order(c("Cook County", "Municipality/Township", "School", "Miscellaneous")) %>%
    fmt(agency_name, fns = str_to_title) %>%
    fmt_currency(c(final_dist_tax, rpm_tif_to_dist, total_tax_agency)) %>%
    tab_options(row_group.as_column = T) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = list(
            cell_text(weight = "bold")
        ),
        locations = list(
            cells_body(columns = total_tax_agency),
            cells_column_labels(columns = total_tax_agency)
        )
    )
```

`r if((!isTRUE(nchar(tif_agency_nums) > 0)) || (!"030210900" %in% tif_agency_nums)) {"-->"}`
